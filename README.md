# AutoSecGPT

AutoSecGPT is an AI-powered tool designed to help teams produce better threat models for their automotive applications. Aligned with the ISO/SAE 21434 standard, AutoSecGPT supports security teams by facilitating the entire cybersecurity engineering processâ€”from threat identification to risk assessment. It helps anticipate and prepare for potential attack scenarios by emphasizing the identification and assessment of cybersecurity risks, a key aspect of ISO/SAE 21434. The tool addresses gaps in threat modeling, a critical activity in the automotive software development lifecycle that is often overlooked or poorly executed.

## Features
- **Works with various LLMs**: Leverage OpenAI and other large language models to analyze automotive threat scenarios.
- **Automotive-specific threat identification**: Recognize and assess security threats unique to automotive systems.
- **Generate detailed threat scenarios**: Automatically generate scenarios and descriptions to enhance risk understanding.
- **Visualize attack graphs**: Understand the root causes of threats through detailed attack graphs.
- **Conduct risk assessments**: Perform likelihood and impact assessments to prioritize threats and propose mitigation strategies.
- **TARA support**: Supports Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) as defined by ISO/SAE 21434 for the automotive industry.
